# ai-multiface-detection

This project involves writing code for face detection using PyTorch. To get started, you'll need to have PyTorch installed along with a pre-trained model suitable for face detection. A common strategy for this task is to utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN), trained on a dataset containing faces.

For face detection, we will use the popular MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks), which is a widely adopted model in this field. There is a convenient implementation of MTCNN available in Python, which will aid in efficiently performing face detection tasks.

## Overview:

### Libraries Used

- **PyTorch**: An open-source machine learning library used for a wide variety of deep learning applications. It provides tools to create and train neural networks in a flexible way.

- **facenet-pytorch**: A library that provides pre-trained models and utilities for face detection and face verification. It includes the MTCNN face detection model, making it easy to implement reliable face detection with minimal code.

- **NumPy**: A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is used for handling arrays and performing mathematical operations.

- **OpenCV**: A powerful library for real-time computer vision tasks. In this project, itâ€™s used to read and process images.

- **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: The PIL, now maintained under the name "Pillow," adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter, which allows opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.

- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for the Python programming language. It is used to visualize the images and the detected faces with bounding boxes.

### MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks)

MTCNN is a face detection model that uses a cascade of neural network stages to predict face locations and landmarks efficiently. It is especially noted for handling challenges such as varying facial conditions, poses, and occlusions effectively. Its multitasking capability enables it to predict both the bounding box of faces and facial landmarks jointly, which improves detection accuracy.

## Execution Instructions:

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary packages. You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install torch facenet-pytorch opencv-python pillow matplotlib
```

### 2. Preparing the Environment

Place your image file for face detection in an accessible directory. Update the script with the correct path to your image.
tate-of-the-art
### 3. Running the Script

1. Save the face detection script as `face_detection.py`.

2. Run the script using Python:

```bash
python face_detection.py
```

### 4. Understanding the Output

Upon execution, the script loads the specified image, utilizes MTCNN to detect faces, and then displays the image with drawn bounding boxes around detected faces. The number of detected faces is also printed in the console.
